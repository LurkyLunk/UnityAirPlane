# Airplane Controller

The Airplane Controller is a Unity project that provides a realistic and customizable airplane controller for flight simulation games.

## Overview

The Airplane Controller is designed to simulate the behavior and physics of an airplane, offering an immersive flying experience. It provides a range of features and customization options to suit different game genres and player preferences.

## Features

- Realistic flight physics for accurate airplane dynamics and handling.
- Smooth and responsive controls for intuitive flying.
- Configurable parameters for throttle, pitch, roll, yaw, and more.
- Support for various input methods, including keyboard, gamepad, and joystick controls.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in Unity.

3. In the Unity Editor, navigate to the **Scenes** folder.

4. Open the main game scene to start working with the Airplane Controller.

## Usage

1. Attach the Airplane Controller scripts to your airplane object:
   - Select your airplane object in the Unity Scene view.
   - Drag and drop the following scripts from the **Scripts** folder onto your airplane object:
     - `AirplaneController.cs`
     - `AirplaneTakeOff.cs`     

2. Configure the airplane controller parameters:
   - Adjust the variables exposed in the **Inspector** window of the attached scripts to fine-tune the airplane's behavior, such as throttle sensitivity, pitch and roll controls, and maximum speeds.
   - Customize the camera settings to achieve the desired cockpit view and camera angles.

3. Set up your game environment and create flight scenarios:
   - Design or import the terrain, skybox, and other objects to create the flying environment.
   - Create landing strips, airports, or waypoints for different flight scenarios.

4. Press the **Play** button in Unity to test and fly the airplane in your game.
